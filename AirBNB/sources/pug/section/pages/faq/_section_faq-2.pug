          h6.text-ubold Why should I work with real estate agent?
          p There are three main reasons which agent is absolutely necessary.
            | First off is the knowledge of juridical laws and regulations. Laws regulate who can operate on the real estate market and who can take part in the mediation, and who not. Therefore it's clear, that you should choose a legitimate agent, instead one who operates outside of the laws and regulations.
            | Second is the expertise of a licensed real estate agent. Every legitimate real estate agent, apart from his professional education, has expertise, wich allows him to operate professionally and diligently on the real estate market to your benefit. With his help all legal regulations are adhered to.
            | The third reason is security. Through the mediation of a real estate agent, the resulting contract will protect all your rights and interests.
